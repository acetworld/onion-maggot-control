\section{Introduction}
\section{Materials and Methods}

Field trials evaluating the efficacy of attract and kill strategies to manage onion maggot populations were conducted from 2006 to 2008 in commercial dry bulb onion fields on muck soils in upstate New York.  Muck soils are high organic matter soils formed from old lake beds.  Trials were conducted from May to September.  

\subsection{Population Monitoring}

Population monitoring of onion maggot adults was accomplished by deploying white sticky cards with six replications in experimental plots.  Cards were collected weekly and the number of males and females counted.  

\subsection{Onion Maggot Mortality}

The ability of spinosad spheres to kill onion maggot flies was
